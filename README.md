# Mathematics-with-programming
Implementations of various Mathematical concepts through code. Code and explanations.
This is a folder of various Mathematical concepts learnt mostly in my course work. These are essential in understanding the science behind computers, programming among other interesting aspects of life.
## Topics to be covered:
#### Calculus I, II and III
###### Definition
The branch of mathematics that deals with the finding rate of changes(derivatives) and summations(integration).
The two main types are differential calculus and integral calculus. Some of the concepts that use calculus include motion, electricity, heat, light, harmonics, acoustics, and astronomy. 
Calculus is used in geography, computer vision (such as for autonomous driving of cars), photography, artificial intelligence, robotics, video games, and even movies. 
Calculus is also used to calculate the rates of radioactive decay in chemistry, and even to predict birth and death rates, as well as in the study of gravity and planetary motion, fluid flow, ship design, geometric curves, and bridge engineering. 
###### Discrete Mathematics - basis for computer logic.
###### Number Theory -advancement for Discrete Mathematics, it helps understand numbers better(Whole Numbers, Z) Congruences, Pell's Equation, Euler's Theorem, etc.
###### Algebraic Structures
###### Linear Algebra
